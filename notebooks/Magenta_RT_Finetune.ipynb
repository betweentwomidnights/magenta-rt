        "This notebook shows how [Magenta RealTime](https://g.co/magenta/rt) can be customized through finetuning. You can either (1) follow the steps to train on your own audio dataset or (2) explore an existing finetuned model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Finetuning Magenta RT on your own data\n",
        "For finetuning, follow the notebook step by step. We recommend at least ~30 minutes of audio of consistent style, but you're free to experiment with something different. Finetuning allows you to build a custom model that sounds uniquely yours, so curating your own training data, and experimenting with it, is an important part of the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Exploring finetuned models\n",
        "#### ⭐️ Holly Herndon x Magenta RT ⭐️\n",
        "We're thrilled to have worked with [Holly Herndon](https://herndondryhurst.studio/) to finetune a model on her vocal style to share with all of you. To play with this model, run [Step 1](#scrollTo=RP-rwG3Uzz_1) and [Step 4](#scrollTo=94S5nEXipBAY) of the notebook, selecting `holly_finetune` as the checkpoint to load.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to the [base Magenta RT demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/magenta/magenta-realtime/blob/main/notebooks/Magenta_RT_Demo.ipynb), this demo includes additional prompt controls that allow you to steer the model towards styles that are more in-distribution with respect to the finetuning dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "We particularly recommend experimenting with the in-distribution controls with this model and noticing how mixing in the mean and centroids affects the generation. You might hear vocalizations that contour many the generated sounds, or, in some cases, \"color\" the instruments with a timbre that resembles Holly's voice (e.g. trumpet/violin oscillate between what you'd expect and her voice).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Loading your own finetuned model\n",
        "If you have already finetuned your own model in a previous session and would like to load it in the demo, run [Step 1](#scrollTo=RP-rwG3Uzz_1) and follow the instructions in [Step 4](#scrollTo=94S5nEXipBAY)."

This can be beneficial when the finetuning data has a narrow coverage of sounds compared to pre-training (as is usually the case). Guiding the model towards in-distribution styles can turn the limited size and diversity of the finetuning data into a feature rather than a bug: out-of-domain prompts mixed with in-distribution embeddings often result in audio that retains some of the original prompt direction, while also being \"infused\" with sonic characteristics typical of the finetuning domain. Alongside the mean style embedding, we expose some cluster centroids as additional in-distribution prompts to achieve similar effects on more compact subspaces of the overall finetuning space.\n",
